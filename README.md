- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevin-warshaw
  - I'm a Software Engineer at Google in the San Francisco bay area
  - I graduated from the University of Virginia with a Computer Engineering major
  - When I'm not coding I like to get outside by going on hikes, playing pickleball, or taking my dog on a walk
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Developing programs/products that people will use on a daily basis
  - Collaborating with others to learn outside of my comfort zone
  - Following my curiosity wherever it leads me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Techniques for building AI models. I'm applying what I learn to my NFL statistic predictor model.
  - Basic web development principles and React through my personal "BuildMyBudget" project. The repository for this project is public, check it out if you get the chance!
